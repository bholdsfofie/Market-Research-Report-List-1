<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bispecific Antibody Drug Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fragment-Based</li><li>IgG-Based</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The bispecific antibody drug market is primarily categorized into two types: fragment-based and IgG-based bispecific antibodies. Fragment-based bispecifics utilize smaller antibody fragments, which can enhance tissue penetration and reduce immunogenicity, making them suitable for targeted therapies. In contrast, IgG-based bispecifics retain the full-length IgG structure, enhancing stability and therapeutic efficacy. Both types play a crucial role in advancing cancer immunotherapy and other disease treatments by simultaneously targeting multiple antigens to improve therapeutic outcomes.</p></p>
