<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aftermarket Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct TPMS</li><li>Indirect TPMS</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Aftermarket Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) market includes two main types: Direct TPMS and Indirect TPMS. Direct TPMS uses sensors inside each tire to measure real-time pressure and transmit data to the vehicle's system, offering precise readings. Indirect TPMS relies on wheel speed sensors and ABS systems to estimate pressure based on tire rotation differences, making it less accurate but more cost-effective. Both systems enhance safety by alerting drivers to pressure issues, but Direct TPMS is more reliable for precise monitoring.</p></p>
