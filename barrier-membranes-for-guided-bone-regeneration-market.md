<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Barrier Membranes for Guided Bone Regeneration Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable Membrane</li><li>Non-absorbable Membrane</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Barrier membranes for guided bone regeneration (GBR) are crucial in dental and orthopedic procedures. They help direct bone growth by separating the regenerating tissue from other types of tissue. The market is segmented into absorbable and non-absorbable membranes. Absorbable membranes gradually dissolve over time, eliminating the need for surgical removal, while non-absorbable membranes provide long-term support but require a second procedure for removal. Both types serve to enhance bone regeneration, with specific applications based on treatment needs.</p></p>
