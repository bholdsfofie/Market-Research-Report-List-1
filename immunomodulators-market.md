<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Immunomodulators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Immunosuppressant</li><li>Immunostimulants</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The immunomodulators market is divided into two main types: immunosuppressants and immunostimulants. Immunosuppressants are agents that inhibit or reduce the strength of the body's immune response, often used in conditions like autoimmune diseases and organ transplantation to prevent rejection. Conversely, immunostimulants enhance the immune response, aiding in the treatment of infectious diseases or cancers by boosting the body's defenses. Both categories play crucial roles in managing various health conditions by modulating immune system activity for therapeutic benefit.</p></p>
