<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Handheld Laser Rangefinder Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Phase Method Rangefinder</li><li>Pulse Method Rangefinder</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The handheld laser rangefinder market features two primary types: phase method rangefinders and pulse method rangefinders. Phase method rangefinders determine distance by measuring the phase shift of the laser beam reflected from the target, providing continuous and quick measurements. In contrast, pulse method rangefinders emit short laser pulses and calculate distance based on the time taken for the pulse to return, ideal for longer ranges. Both technologies cater to various applications, including surveying, forestry, and construction.</p></p>
