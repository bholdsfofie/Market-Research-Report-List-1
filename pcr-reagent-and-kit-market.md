<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PCR Reagent and Kit Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Built-in Hot Start</li><li>No built-in Hot Start</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The PCR reagent and kit market can be divided into two main types: built-in hot start and no built-in hot start. Built-in hot start PCR reagents are designed to remain inactive at room temperature, preventing non-specific amplification until the reaction reaches a specific temperature, thus enhancing specificity and yield. In contrast, no built-in hot start reagents are always active, which can lead to higher background noise but may be simpler to use in certain applications. Each type serves different research and diagnostic needs.</p></p>
